        <p>The SKYPATH app presents real-time turbulence conditions along the planned flight route, enabling airline planners and pilots to optimally and economically avoid severe conditions.</p>
        <p>The app gathers information regarding turbulence strength from the iPad’s accelerometer and altitude/location from it’s GPS, It transmits this data to the SkyPath servers hosted on the AWS cloud. This data provides vital information for the different altitude layers to all pilots using the system.</p>
        <p>Airline pilots are equipped with Electronic Flight Bags (EFB) tablets with which they perform many tasks during flights. By using the Skypath app on their iPads, they become part of the crowdsourcing solution. This enables both pilots and dispatchers to utilize real-time access to turbulence conditions overlaid on geographic world maps supplied over internet networking.</p>
